## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Employee attrition is a costly and disruptive problem. Most organizations lack a data-driven approach to predict and mitigate turnover. This project leverages machine learning to forecast attrition risk and identify contributing factors.

## 🎯 Goals  
- Predict probability of employee attrition using Random Forest  
- Visualize important factors driving attrition  
- Enable HR to take preventive actions  
- Build a user-friendly interface for secure HR access

## 🧪 Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned and prepared HR dataset (~1700 records)  
   - Created target labels for attrition  

2. **Modeling**  
   - Used Random Forest Classifier for prediction  
   - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal accuracy  
   - Analyzed feature importance  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Dashboards showing attrition risk and key metrics  
   - Attrition List flagging high-risk employees  

4. **Interface**  
   - Login page for HR access  
   - Navigation through dashboard, predictions, and survey forms
